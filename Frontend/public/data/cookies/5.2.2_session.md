## **Session Storage**

Stores data temporarily for the duration of a page session. The data is cleared when the browser tab is closed, but it remains available across page reloads. It is ideal for storing data that only needs to persist within a single session (e.g., form data during navigation).The methods you can use to perform operations on the localStorage object are:

- **sessionStorage.setItem()** takes a key and value as parameters and sets a new item in the session storage object equal to the given key value pair.

- **sessionStorage.getItem()** takes a key as a parameter and returns the value stored to that key in the storage.

- **sessionStorage.clear()** clears the whole sessionStorage object.

- **sessionStorage.removeItem()** takes in a key as a parameter and removes the corresponding key-value pair.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
let username = sessionStorage.getItem('username');
sessionStorage.removeItem('username');
```
