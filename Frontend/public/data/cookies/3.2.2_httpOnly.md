## **HttpOnly Attribute**

The `HttpOnly` attribute is used to enhance security by preventing client-side access to the cookie. This means the cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript, reducing the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Example:

To store a session ID cookie with the HttpOnly flag:

```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly
```

In this example:
- `session_id=abc123`: Stores the session ID for the user.
- `HttpOnly`: Ensures the cookie can only be accessed by the server, not by client-side scripts.
- `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTPS.

The `HttpOnly` flag is crucial for preventing malicious scripts from stealing sensitive data stored in cookies.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack Scenario

```javascript
app.get("/results", (req, res) => {
  const searchQuery = req.query.search; 
  const results = getResults(searchQuery); 
  res.send(`
    <h1>You searched for ${searchQuery}</h1>
    <p>Here are the results: ${results}</p>`);
});
```

## User Search for:

```html
<a href="http://example.org/results?search=<script>document.cookie;alert(cookie);</script>"> 
  Get a free kitten!</a>
```
