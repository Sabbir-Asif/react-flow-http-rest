## **HttpOnly Attribute**

The `HttpOnly` attribute is used to enhance security by preventing client-side access to the cookie. This means the cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript, reducing the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Example:

To store a session ID cookie with the HttpOnly flag:

```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly
```

In this example:
- `session_id=abc123`: Stores the session ID for the user.
- `HttpOnly`: Ensures the cookie can only be accessed by the server, not by client-side scripts.
- `Secure`: Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTPS.

The `HttpOnly` flag is crucial for preventing malicious scripts from stealing sensitive data stored in cookies.
