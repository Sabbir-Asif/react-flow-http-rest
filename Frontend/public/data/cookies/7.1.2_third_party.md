# Third-Party Cookies and SameSite Changes 

Web browsers like **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Safari** have progressively restricted or blocked third-party cookies by default due to growing **privacy concerns** and made samsite lax default. Third-party cookies are those set by a domain different from the website the user is currently visiting. These cookies are commonly used for:

- **Cross-site tracking**
- **Targeted advertising**
- **Analytics**

Though these features got blocked but with the increased restrictions on third-party cookies, both Google and Apple introduced new privacy-focused alternatives to traditional tracking mechanisms.

## **Google's Privacy Sandbox (2021)**

Google introduced the **Privacy Sandbox** as an alternative to third-party cookies, focusing on privacy-preserving advertising technologies. Its goal is to allow advertisers to target users effectively while maintaining privacy.

Key components of the **Privacy Sandbox** include:

- **FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts)**: Groups users based on shared browsing behavior, allowing advertisers to target cohorts rather than individuals.
- **FLEDGE**: A proposal for interest-based advertising that uses data stored locally on users’ devices, avoiding third-party tracking.
- **Conversion Measurement API**: Enables ad performance measurement without exposing individual user data.

These technologies aim to provide privacy-conscious alternatives for advertisers and businesses, while minimizing data exposure.

## **Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) (2021)**

**App Tracking Transparency (ATT)**, introduced in **iOS 14.5**, requires apps to request user permission before tracking their activity across other apps and websites.

Key features of **ATT** include:

- Apps must explicitly ask for user permission to track data across apps or websites.
- If a user denies permission, the app cannot track the user for personalized ads or cross-app analytics.
- ATT offers users more control over their data and enhances transparency in how their data is used.

This initiative helps protect user privacy by limiting cross-app tracking and providing more visibility into which apps are tracking users.
