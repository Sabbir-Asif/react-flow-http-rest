## **Secure Flag**

The `Secure` flag ensures that cookies are only transmitted over secure, encrypted HTTPS connections. This prevents cookies from being sent over unencrypted HTTP connections, where they could be intercepted by attackers in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### Example:

To store a cookie with the Secure flag:

```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly
```

In this example:
- `session_id=abc123`: Stores the session ID for the user.
- `Secure`: Directs the browser to send the cookie only over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted transmission.
- `HttpOnly`: Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie.

For maximum security, cookies with the `Secure` flag should only be set over a secure HTTPS connection to prevent interception during transmission.
