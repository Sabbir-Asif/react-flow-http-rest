# Secure-Persistent Cookie
Over time, concerns about privacy and data misuse led to stricter regulations like GDPR and browser restrictions on third-party cookies. To enhance security, features like `HttpOnly` (preventing JavaScript access), `Secure` flag (ensuring HTTPS transmission), and persistent cookies (allowing long-term storage) were introduced, balancing convenience with privacy protection.

## Limitations:

- Cookies were not ideal for client-side data storage due to their small size and network overhead.
- No standard way to enforce user consent, with many companies ignoring this.
- Websites were vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## Key Addition of Cookies in this decade:

1. **Secure Flag** – Ensuring safe cookie transmission over HTTPS.
2. **Persistent Cookies** – Maintaining sessions beyond browser closure.
3. **HttpOnly Attribute** – Protecting cookies from JavaScript-based attacks.
