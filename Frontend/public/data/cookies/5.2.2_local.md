## **Local Storage**

- **Purpose**: Stores data persistently until explicitly removed.
- **Persistence**: The data remains available even after the browser is closed or the system is restarted.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for storing user preferences, themes, or any other data that needs to persist across browser sessions.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
let theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
localStorage.removeItem('theme');
```
