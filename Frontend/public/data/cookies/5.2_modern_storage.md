# Client-Side Storage 

Before the introduction of standardized client-side storage APIs like Local Storage, Session Storage, and IndexedDB, web developers relied on several limited or unofficial techniques to persist data on the client side. These early methods played an essential role in enabling stateful web experiences but came with various trade-offs in terms of security, capacity, and usability.

#### **HTTP Cookies**: Cookies were the first mechanism for client-side persistence, introduced by Netscape to maintain state across HTTP requests. Stored as small key-value pairs (typically limited to ~4KB per cookie), cookies allowed websites to remember user sessions, preferences, and identifiers. However, they were included in every HTTP request, which led to bandwidth inefficiency and raised privacy and security concerns.

#### **Hidden Form Fields and URL Parameters**: To transfer temporary data between pages, developers commonly used hidden form fields (`<input type="hidden">`) or embedded data directly in URLs as query parameters. While these approaches did not require additional browser features and offered quick solutions for state management, they were exposed to users, lacked persistence across sessions, and were unsuitable for storing sensitive or structured data.
