## **Local Storage**
The two main types of web storage are‌‌ local storage‌‌ and session storage‌‌. Each one has its own unique characteristics.But one thing they have in common is that they store the data in the particular browser the user uses to access the webpage. You won't be able to access the same data through another browser.

It Stores data persistently until explicitly removed. It can store 5MB of data per app for the lifetime of the app. Closing the browser will not affect the data in any way – it stays there unless you delete it. It is ideal for storing user preferences, themes, or any other data that needs to persist across browser sessions. The methods you can use to perform operations on the localStorage object are:

- **localStorage.setItem()** takes a key and value as parameters and sets a new item in the local storage object equal to the given key value pair.

- **localStorage.getItem()** takes a key as a parameter and returns the value stored to that key in the storage.

- **localStorage.clear()** clears the whole localStorage object.

- **localStorage.removeItem()** takes in a key as a parameter and removes the corresponding key-value pair.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
let theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
localStorage.removeItem('theme');
localStorage.clear();
```
