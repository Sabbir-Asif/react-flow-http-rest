## SameSite=None

The SameSite attribute on cookies is a security feature that controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-site requests (requests initiated from a different domain). Setting SameSite=None allows the cookie to be included in all requests, including cross-site requests, such as those made from iframes, third-party APIs, or redirects from external services. Here are the key Characteristics of SameSite=None:

1. Cross-Site Availability  
   - Cookies with SameSite=None are sent with all requests, including those from different domains.  
   - This is essential when a service operates across multiple sites or embeds external services that require authentication.

2. Secure Required  
   - When using SameSite=None, the cookie must also be marked with the Secure attribute.  
   - This ensures that the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS, providing a basic layer of transport security.

3. CSRF Risk Consideration  
   - Since cookies with SameSite=None are included in cross-site requests, they do not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.  
   - This setting should only be used if cross-site access is absolutely necessary and the environment is well-trusted and secured.

### The need of Samesite=None
We might think that as the samesite attribute introduced to prevent CSRF attack, then why we still need samesite=none as it is not preventing us from CSRF attack!

The reason behind is, we will use SameSite=None only when our application requires it and we are operating in a secure and trusted environment. Because modern browsers **default to SameSite=Lax** if the attribute is not specified. Therefore, unless we explicitly set SameSite=None, the cookie will not be included in cross-site requests.


### Example

```http
Set-Cookie: sessionID=xyz123; SameSite=None; Secure
```

In this example:
- sessionID=xyz123 is the cookie being set.
- SameSite=None allows it to be included in requests from other domains.
- Secure ensures it will only be transmitted over HTTPS.
