## **SameSite=Lax** 

- Cookies are sent with **same-site requests** and **top-level navigation** (e.g., clicking a link).
- Cookies are **not** sent with cross-site subrequests like images, iframes, or AJAX requests.
- This is the default policy if SameSite is not specified.
- You are on `https://google.com` and click a link to visit `https://cookie-rouge.vercel.app`. Since this is a top-level navigation, the SameSite=Lax cookie is sent. However, when loading a resource (like an image) from `https://cookie-rouge.vercel.app/img`, the SameSite=Lax cookie is **not** sent, as it is a cross-site request.

**Coding Example:**
```http
Set-Cookie: sessionID=xyz123; SameSite=lax; Secure
```
