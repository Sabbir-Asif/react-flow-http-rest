## **Google's Privacy Sandbox (2021)**

Google introduced the **Privacy Sandbox** as an alternative to third-party cookies, focusing on privacy-preserving advertising technologies. Its goal is to allow advertisers to target users effectively while maintaining privacy.

Key components of the **Privacy Sandbox** include:

- **FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts)**: Groups users based on shared browsing behavior, allowing advertisers to target cohorts rather than individuals.
- **FLEDGE**: A proposal for interest-based advertising that uses data stored locally on usersâ€™ devices, avoiding third-party tracking.
- **Conversion Measurement API**: Enables ad performance measurement without exposing individual user data.

These technologies aim to provide privacy-conscious alternatives for advertisers and businesses, while minimizing data exposure.
