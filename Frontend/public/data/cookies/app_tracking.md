## **Appleâ€™s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) (2021)**

**App Tracking Transparency (ATT)**, introduced in **iOS 14.5**, requires apps to request user permission before tracking their activity across other apps and websites.

Key features of **ATT** include:

- Apps must explicitly ask for user permission to track data across apps or websites.
- If a user denies permission, the app cannot track the user for personalized ads or cross-app analytics.
- ATT offers users more control over their data and enhances transparency in how their data is used.

This initiative helps protect user privacy by limiting cross-app tracking and providing more visibility into which apps are tracking users.
