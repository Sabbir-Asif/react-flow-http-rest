## **IndexedDB**

A low-level NoSQL key-value database built into browsers, designed for storing structured data. A key-value database associates a key to a value. The key serves as a unique identifier for that value, which means that you can keep track of that value using the key.

If your app needs to fetch data constantly, key-value databases use really efficient and compact index structures to quickly and reliably locate values by their keys. Using the key you are able to not only retrieve the value stored, but also delete, update, and replace the value.

### Use Cases

1. **Storing User-Generated Content**  
   IndexedDB can store data entered by users, such as form inputs. This allows users to leave and return later without losing progress.

2. **Storing Application State**  
   It can save things like login status or API responses, enabling faster load times on future visits since the app doesn’t need to fetch everything from scratch.

3. **Offline Functionality**  
   Apps can function without internet. Users can add or edit data offline, and once reconnected, IndexedDB syncs the data automatically.

### Path 1: When the Database Doesn’t Exist

- It checks if the name exists.
- If not, it triggers the `onupgradeneeded` event to set up the structure.
- After setup, the `onsuccess` event confirms creation.

**Example**
```javascript
const request = indexedDB.open('myDatabase', 1);

request.onupgradeneeded = () => {
  alert("Upgrade needed");
};

request.onsuccess = () => {
  alert("Success is called");
};
```

---

### Path 2: Database Exists, Version is Higher

- It triggers `onupgradeneeded` to apply updates.
- Then triggers `onsuccess`.

**Example**
```javascript
const request = indexedDB.open('myDatabase', 2);

request.onupgradeneeded = () => {
  alert("Upgrade needed");
};

request.onsuccess = () => {
  alert("Success is called");
};
```

---

### Path 3: Version Conflict

If the version is the same:
- It simply calls `onsuccess`.
- No upgrades or changes are made.

If the version provided is **lower** than the existing version:
- The request fails and throws an error.

## Creating Object Stores

An object store is like a table in the database where data is stored.

**Example**
```javascript
let db;
const openRequest = indexedDB.open('myDatabase', 1);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function (e) {
  db = e.target.result;
  db.createObjectStore('myDatabaseStore', { keyPath: "name" });
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function (e) {
  db = e.target.result;
};
```

## Using Transactions to Add Data

Transactions allow grouped operations that either all succeed or all fail. If any part fails, nothing is saved.

**Example:**
```javascript
function addItem() {
  const item = {
    name: 'banana',
    price: '$2.99',
    description: 'It is a purple banana!',
    created: new Date().getTime(),
  };

  const tx = db.transaction("myDatabaseStore", "readwrite");
  const store = tx.objectStore('myDatabaseStore');
  store.add(item);
}
```

To use this after the database opens:

```javascript
openRequest.onsuccess = function (e) {
  db = e.target.result;
  addItem();
};
```
