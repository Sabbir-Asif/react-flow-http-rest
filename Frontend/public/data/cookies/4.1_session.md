##**Session Storage**

- **Purpose**: Stores data temporarily for the duration of a page session.
- **Persistence**: The data is cleared when the browser tab is closed, but it remains available across page reloads.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for storing data that only needs to persist within a single session (e.g., form data during navigation).

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
let username = sessionStorage.getItem('username');
sessionStorage.removeItem('username');
```
