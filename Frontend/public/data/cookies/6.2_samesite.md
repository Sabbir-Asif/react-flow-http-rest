# SameSite Attribute 

### same-site vs same-origin
When we look at the details of SameSite cookies, we're going to be dealing a lot with the concept of "same-site" and "cross-site" requests. This is similar to another phrase you may have heard, "cross-origin" requests, but they are subtly different. Two URLs are considered to be **same-site** if they:
- Have the same scheme i.e. http or https
- Have the same domain i.e. example.com, andrewlock.net or microsoft.com
- They don't need to have the same port or subdomain.

On the other hand two URLs are considered to be **same-origin** if they
- Have the same scheme i.e. http or https
- Have the same domain i.e. example.com, andrewlock.net or microsoft.com
- Have the same subdomain i.e. www.
- Have the same port (which may be implicit) i.e. port 80 for http and 443 for https

In 2016, the **SameSite** attribute was introduced to limit cross-site cookie sharing, helping prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The SameSite attribute defines how cookies should be sent with cross-site requests, providing varying levels of security.

- The user opens the bank website, enters their credentials, and logs in.
- To maintain the session securely, the bank gives the user a session token (like a secret ID that proves they're logged in).
- The hacker creates a forged request that looks like it’s coming from the bank. This could be a link, image, or form on a malicious website/email that the victim clicks on.
- The victim is still logged in to the bank (from step 1), so their browser sends the forged request with the valid session token. The victim doesn’t realize they’re making a request on the hacker's behalf.
- The bank receives the forged request, sees the valid session token, and thinks it’s a legitimate action by the victim.
- It executes the action — maybe transferring money, changing settings, etc.
