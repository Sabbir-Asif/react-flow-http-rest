### same-site vs same-origin
When we look at the details of SameSite cookies, we're going to be dealing a lot with the concept of "same-site" and "cross-site" requests. This is similar to another phrase you may have heard, "cross-origin" requests, but they are subtly different. Two URLs are considered to be **same-site** if they:
- Have the same scheme i.e. http or https
- Have the same domain i.e. example.com, andrewlock.net or microsoft.com
- They don't need to have the same port or subdomain.

On the other hand two URLs are considered to be **same-origin** if they
- Have the same scheme i.e. http or https
- Have the same domain i.e. example.com, andrewlock.net or microsoft.com
- Have the same subdomain i.e. www.
- Have the same port (which may be implicit) i.e. port 80 for http and 443 for https
