# SameSite Attribute 

In 2016, the **SameSite** attribute was introduced to limit cross-site cookie sharing, helping prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The SameSite attribute defines how cookies should be sent with cross-site requests, providing varying levels of security.

## SameSite Attribute Options:

1. **SameSite=Strict** (Strongest Security)
2. **SameSite=Lax** (Balanced Security)
3. **SameSite=None** (Allows Cross-Site Cookies)

## Limitations:

- Third-party cookies were used excessively for tracking purposes, and advertisers heavily relied on them for user tracking across sites.
