## **SameSite=Strict**

- Cookies are **not** sent with any cross-site requests.
- The cookie is only sent when navigating within the same site.
- I built 2 website, where from Website A (https://cookie-si4u.vercel.app/), if I click on a link of another website B (https://cookie-rouge.vercel.app/) and sends the cookies required with the click then the B website will show me an image in the B/img (https://cookie-rouge.vercel.app/img) route. But if I don't send the cookies, or if server B don't get the cookies it will not show the image. Here is a visualization of how it works : 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p align="center">
  <img src="data/cookies/assets/strict2.svg" height="500" width="500" alt="IndexedDB Flow 1">
</div>
