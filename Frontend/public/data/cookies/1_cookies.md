The internet originally lacked memoryâ€”HTTP was stateless. Websites couldn't remember users across pages, leading to frustrating experiences.  

This changed in **1994** when **Lou Montulli** at Netscape introduced **HTTP cookies**, enabling **session management**. Websites could now:  
- Keep users logged in.  
- Track shopping carts.  
- Remember user preferences.  

Cookies revolutionized web browsing, paving the way for personalized experiences and dynamic web applications.
