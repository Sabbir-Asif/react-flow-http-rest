## **Persistent Cookies**

Persistent cookies allow you to maintain user sessions and settings even after the browser is closed. These cookies have an expiration date, and the data stored in them is preserved until that date is reached.

### Example:

To store a persistent cookie with an expiration date:

```http
Set-Cookie: id=xyz123; Expires=Thu, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT;
```

In this example:
- `id=xyz123`: Stores a unique identifier for the user.
- `Expires=Thu, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT`: Sets the cookie to expire on December 31, 2025, at 11:59:59 PM UTC. This ensures the cookie remains valid beyond the current session.

Persistent cookies are commonly used for user authentication and session management.
