# PATCH Method in HTTP

The **PATCH** method was introduced in **RFC 5789 (March 2010)** as part of the HTTP protocol to allow **partial updates** to a resource. Before PATCH was available, only **PUT** could be used for updates, but it required replacing the entire resource, even if only a small part needed modification. The main reasons of why it was introduced are: 
- **PUT** is **idempotent** and meant for **full resource updates**, meaning you must send the entire resource representation, which can be inefficient.
- In web applications, especially frameworks like **Ruby on Rails**, updating forms often required modifying only specific fields.
- **PATCH** was introduced to solve this problem by allowing clients to send only the **modified fields**, reducing bandwidth usage and making updates more flexible.

### **Example**
#### **1. Increasing Balance**
```http
PATCH /account/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "balance": "+100"
}
```
- Every time a **PATCH** request is made, the balance increases by **100**.

#### **2. Updating User Email**
##### **Request:**
```http
PATCH /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "niloy@example.com"
}
```
##### **Existing Data Before PATCH:**
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890"
}
```
##### **Data After PATCH:**
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "niloy@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890"
}
```
- Only the **email** field is updated, leaving other fields unchanged.

## **PUT vs PATCH**
Although **PUT** can achieve the same functionality as **PATCH**, both methods exist for different use cases:

| Feature        | PUT | PATCH |
|---------------|-----|-------|
| **Update Type** | Full replacement | Partial update |
| **Efficiency** | Requires sending the entire resource | Only sends the modified fields |
| **Idempotent?** | Yes | No |
| **Example Use Case** | Updating all user details | Updating only one field (e.g., email) |
