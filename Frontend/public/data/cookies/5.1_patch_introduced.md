# PATCH Method in HTTP

The **PATCH** method was introduced in **RFC 5789 (March 2010)** as part of the HTTP protocol to allow **partial updates** to a resource. Before PATCH was available, only **PUT** could be used for updates, but it required replacing the entire resource, even if only a small part needed modification. The main reasons of why it was introduced are: 
- **PUT** is **idempotent** and meant for **full resource updates**, meaning you must send the entire resource representation, which can be inefficient.
- In web applications, especially frameworks like **Ruby on Rails**, updating forms often required modifying only specific fields. **PATCH** was introduced to solve this problem by allowing clients to send only the **modified fields**, reducing bandwidth usage and making updates more flexible.

## **1. PATCH is not idempotent**
```http
PATCH /account/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "balance": "+100"
}
```
Every time a **PATCH** request is made, the balance increases by **100** (using parseInt).

## **2. PATCH vs PUT**
###### **Data**
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890"
}
```
###### **Request using PATCH**
```http
PATCH /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "niloy@example.com"
}
```
###### **Response using PATCH**
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "niloy@example.com",
  "phone": "1234567890"
}
```
Only the **email** field is updated, leaving other fields unchanged.
<br> <br>
###### **Request using PUT**
```http
PATCH /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "niloy@example.com"
}
```
###### **Response using PUT**
```json
{
  "email": "niloy@example.com"
}
```
Entire field is replaced by **email** field.
