# Third-Party Cookies and SameSite Changes 

Web browsers like **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Safari** have progressively restricted or blocked third-party cookies by default due to growing **privacy concerns** and made samsite lax default. Third-party cookies are those set by a domain different from the website the user is currently visiting. These cookies are commonly used for:

- **Cross-site tracking**
- **Targeted advertising**
- **Analytics**

Though these features got blocked but with the increased restrictions on third-party cookies, both Google and Apple introduced new privacy-focused alternatives to traditional tracking mechanisms.
