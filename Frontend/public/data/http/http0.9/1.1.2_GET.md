# HTTP Request and Response Example

Requests consisted of a single line and started with the only possible method `GET` followed by the path to the resource. The full URL wasn't included as the protocol, server, and port weren't necessary once connected to the server.

## Example Request

<figure>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/data/http/http0.9/asset/get1.png" height="400" width="700" style="border: 2px solid black;">
  </div>
  <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>  
</figure>

## Example Response

<figure>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/data/http/http0.9/asset/get2.png" height="400" width="700" style="border: 2px solid black;">
  </div>
  <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>  
</figure>

## Live Protocol Demonstration
This simple design made HTTP usable directly via Telnet. Some servers still support this today:

<figure>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/data/http/http0.9/asset/get3.png" height="400" width="700" style="border: 2px solid black;">
  </div>
  <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>  
</figure>


### Key Points
- Early HTTP requests were single-line commands
- Only the GET method was available initially
- Responses contained just the raw file content
