# HTTP/1.0 Keep-Alive Connection Documentation


## Standard HTTP/1.0 Behavior
* By default, HTTP/1.0 servers **must close the connection** immediately after sending the response.
* Each request/response cycle requires a new TCP connection.

## Keep-Alive Extension

### Client Implementation
* To enable connection reuse, clients should include the header:
<figure>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/data/http/http1.0/asset/keepalive1.png" height="400" width="700" style="border: 2px solid black;">
  </div>
  <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>  
</figure>

* This header indicates the client's support for persistent connections.

### Server Implementation
* Upon receiving a request with `Connection: keep-alive`, if supported:
   1. The server processes the request normally
   2. Includes the same header in the response:
<figure>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/data/http/http1.0/asset/keepalive1.png" height="400" width="700" style="border: 2px solid black;">
  </div>
  <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>  
</figure>
   3. Keeps the connection open after sending the response

## Connection Termination
The connection can be terminated by either party by:
1. Omitting the `Connection` header in the final message, or
2. Explicitly specifying:
<figure>
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/data/http/http1.0/asset/keepalive2.png" height="400" width="700" style="border: 2px solid black;">
  </div>
  <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>  
</figure>

## Historical Context
* This extension was developed as an optimization to avoid the overhead of establishing new TCP connections for each request.
* While unofficial, it became widely adopted by major browsers and servers starting in late 1995.
* This functionality was later standardized in HTTP/1.1 as persistent connections.
