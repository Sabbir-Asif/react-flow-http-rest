# HTTP/1.1 Status Codes: Purpose & Solutions

## 1xx - Informational

### 100 Continue
**Purpose:** Verify server acceptance before sending request body.

**Solution:** Prevents wasteful transmission of large payloads.


```http
# Client request
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 5000000
Expect: 100-continue

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 100 Continue

# Now client sends the request body...
```

---

## 2xx - Success

### 206 Partial Content
**Purpose:** Responds with requested portion of content.

**Solution:** Enables resumable downloads and media streaming.


```http
# Client request
GET /video.mp4 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Range: bytes=1024-2047

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 1024-2047/10000000
Content-Length: 1024

[Partial content data]
```

---

## 3xx - Redirection

### 307 Temporary Redirect
**Purpose:** Preserves original request method during redirect.

**Solution:** Ensures method consistency (unlike 302).


```http
# Client request
POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

name=John&comment=Hello

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Location: /new-endpoint

# Client will make a new POST request to /new-endpoint
```

---

## 4xx - Client Error

### 409 Conflict
**Purpose:** Request conflicts with resource state.

**Solution:** Handles concurrent modification issues.


```http
# Client request with outdated version
PUT /documents/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
If-Match: "abc123"

{updated content}

# Server response when document has been modified
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Document has been modified since retrieval",
  "currentETag": "def456"
}
```

### 410 Gone
**Purpose:** Resource permanently unavailable.

**Solution:** Distinguishes between temporary (404) and permanent removal.

```http
# Client request
GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

# Server response for deprecated API
HTTP/1.1 410 Gone
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "This API version has been permanently removed",
  "migration": "Please use /api/v2/users"
}
```

### 413 Request Entity Too Large
**Purpose:** Request payload exceeds server limits.

**Solution:** Prevents resource exhaustion and DoS attacks.

---

```http
# Client attempt to upload large file
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 500000000

[Large file data]

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 413 Request Entity Too Large
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "File exceeds maximum upload size of 10MB"
}
```

---

## 5xx - Server Error

### 503 Service Unavailable
**Purpose:** Server temporarily unable to handle requests.

**Solution:** Signals maintenance with retry information.


```http
# Client request during maintenance
GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Retry-After: 3600
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "maintenance",
  "message": "System undergoing scheduled maintenance",
  "estimatedCompletion": "2023-06-15T15:30:00Z"
}
```

### 504 Gateway Timeout
**Purpose:** Gateway/proxy timed out waiting for upstream.

**Solution:** Helps diagnose issues in multi-server architectures.


```http
# Client request
GET /api/external-data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

# Gateway response when backend service is slow
HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "The request to the upstream service timed out",
  "retryAdvised": true
}
```

> These status codes transformed HTTP from a simple document retrieval protocol into a robust foundation for modern web applications and APIs.
