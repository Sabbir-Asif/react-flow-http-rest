# Important HTTP/1.1 Status Codes: Purpose, Problems Solved, and Examples

## 1xx - Informational

### 100 Continue
**Purpose:** Allows clients to verify if the server is willing to accept a request before sending the request body.

**Problem Solved:** Prevented wasteful transmission of large request bodies when the server might reject them based on headers alone.

```http
# Client request
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 5000000
Expect: 100-continue

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 100 Continue

# Now client sends the request body...
```

## 2xx - Success

### 206 Partial Content
**Purpose:** Responds to Range requests with just the requested portion of content.

**Problem Solved:** Enabled resume-able downloads and media streaming, critical for efficient large file transfers and video playback.

```http
# Client request
GET /video.mp4 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Range: bytes=1024-2047

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 1024-2047/10000000
Content-Length: 1024

[Partial content data]
```

## 3xx - Redirection

### 307 Temporary Redirect
**Purpose:** Similar to 302 but explicitly preserves the original request method.

**Problem Solved:** Addressed ambiguity in how browsers handled 302 redirects with non-GET methods, ensuring method preservation.

```http
# Client request
POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

name=John&comment=Hello

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
Location: /new-endpoint

# Client will make a new POST request to /new-endpoint
```

## 4xx - Client Error

### 409 Conflict
**Purpose:** Indicates that the request couldn't be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.

**Problem Solved:** Standardized error handling for concurrent modification issues, critical for collaborative applications.

```http
# Client request with outdated version
PUT /documents/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
If-Match: "abc123"

{updated content}

# Server response when document has been modified
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Document has been modified since retrieval",
  "currentETag": "def456"
}
```

### 410 Gone
**Purpose:** Indicates that the resource is permanently unavailable and no forwarding address is known.

**Problem Solved:** Distinguished between temporary unavailability (404) and permanent removal, allowing clients to update bookmarks and caches accordingly.

```http
# Client request
GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

# Server response for deprecated API
HTTP/1.1 410 Gone
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "This API version has been permanently removed",
  "migration": "Please use /api/v2/users"
}
```

### 413 Request Entity Too Large
**Purpose:** Indicates that the request payload exceeds server limits.

**Problem Solved:** Protected servers from resource exhaustion due to overly large requests, preventing potential denial of service.

```http
# Client attempt to upload large file
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 500000000

[Large file data]

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 413 Request Entity Too Large
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "File exceeds maximum upload size of 10MB"
}
```

## 5xx - Server Error

### 503 Service Unavailable
**Purpose:** Indicates the server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to overloading or maintenance.

**Problem Solved:** Provided a standard way to signal temporary service disruption with retry information, improving user experience during outages.

```http
# Client request during maintenance
GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

# Server response
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Retry-After: 3600
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "maintenance",
  "message": "System undergoing scheduled maintenance",
  "estimatedCompletion": "2023-06-15T15:30:00Z"
}
```

### 504 Gateway Timeout
**Purpose:** Indicates that a gateway or proxy timed out waiting for a response from an upstream server.

**Problem Solved:** Distinguished between direct server timeouts and gateway/proxy timeouts, helping pinpoint issues in multi-server architectures.

```http
# Client request
GET /api/external-data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

# Gateway response when backend service is slow
HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "The request to the upstream service timed out",
  "retryAdvised": true
}
```

These status codes transformed HTTP from a simple document retrieval protocol into a robust foundation for modern web applications and APIs. They provided developers with a more expressive communication protocol to handle complex scenarios like concurrent modifications, service disruptions, and content delivery optimization.
