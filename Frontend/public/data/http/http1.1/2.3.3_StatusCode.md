# New Status Codes Introduced in HTTP/1.1

## Introduction

HTTP/1.1, standardized in RFC 2068 (1997) and updated in RFC 2616 (1999), introduced numerous status codes that were not present in the original HTTP/1.0 specification. These new status codes addressed specific operational needs and edge cases that emerged as the web evolved from a simple document retrieval system into a platform for interactive applications and services.

## Status Codes Added in HTTP/1.1

### 1xx (Informational)
These were entirely new to HTTP/1.1, as HTTP/1.0 had no informational status codes:

**100 Continue**
- **Purpose:** Allows clients to verify if the server is willing to accept a request before sending the request body.
- **Problem Solved:** Prevented wasteful transmission of large request bodies when the server would reject them based on headers alone.

**101 Switching Protocols**
- **Purpose:** Indicates the server is switching to a different protocol as requested by the client.
- **Problem Solved:** Enabled protocol upgrades within an established connection, particularly important for WebSocket.

### 2xx (Success)

**203 Non-Authoritative Information**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that returned metadata is from a local or third-party copy, not the origin server.
- **Problem Solved:** Provided transparency about the source of information when passing through proxies or caches.

**205 Reset Content**
- **Purpose:** Directs the client to reset the document view after a form submission.
- **Problem Solved:** Addressed the need for server-directed UI refreshes in early web applications.

**206 Partial Content**
- **Purpose:** Responds to Range requests with just the requested portion of content.
- **Problem Solved:** Enabled resume-able downloads and media streaming, critical for large file transfers.

### 3xx (Redirection)

**303 See Other**
- **Purpose:** Directs clients to retrieve a different resource via GET, regardless of the original request method.
- **Problem Solved:** Provided a standard way to redirect after POST operations.

**305 Use Proxy**
- **Purpose:** Indicated that the requested resource must be accessed through a specific proxy.
- **Problem Solved:** Supported enterprise network architectures requiring controlled external access.

**307 Temporary Redirect**
- **Purpose:** Similar to 302 but explicitly preserves the original request method.
- **Problem Solved:** Addressed ambiguity in how browsers handled 302 redirects with non-GET methods.

### 4xx (Client Error)

**402 Payment Required**
- **Purpose:** Reserved for future use in digital payment systems.
- **Problem Anticipated:** The need for standardized payment negotiation on the web.

**405 Method Not Allowed**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that the request method is not supported for the requested resource.
- **Problem Solved:** Provided clarity when resources supported some HTTP methods but not others.

**406 Not Acceptable**
- **Purpose:** Indicates the server cannot produce a response matching the list of acceptable values in request headers.
- **Problem Solved:** Formalized content negotiation failure responses.

**407 Proxy Authentication Required**
- **Purpose:** Similar to 401 but for proxy server authentication.
- **Problem Solved:** Distinguished between origin server and proxy authentication requirements.

**408 Request Timeout**
- **Purpose:** Indicates the server timed out waiting for the complete request.
- **Problem Solved:** Standardized handling of slow or incomplete client requests.

**409 Conflict**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that the request couldn't be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.
- **Problem Solved:** Standardized error handling for concurrent modification issues.

**410 Gone**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that the resource is permanently unavailable and no forwarding address is known.
- **Problem Solved:** Distinguished between temporary unavailability (404) and permanent removal.

**411 Length Required**
- **Purpose:** Indicates the server requires a Content-Length header.
- **Problem Solved:** Protected servers from indefinite waiting for request completion.

**412 Precondition Failed**
- **Purpose:** Indicates a condition set in request headers was not met.
- **Problem Solved:** Enabled conditional operations, particularly for caching and concurrent updates.

**413 Request Entity Too Large**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that the request payload exceeds server limits.
- **Problem Solved:** Protected servers from resource exhaustion due to overly large requests.

**414 Request-URI Too Long**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that the URI is too long for the server to process.
- **Problem Solved:** Protected against denial of service attacks using extremely long URLs.

**415 Unsupported Media Type**
- **Purpose:** Indicates the server refuses to service the request because the payload format is unsupported.
- **Problem Solved:** Standardized rejection of incompatible content types.

**416 Range Not Satisfiable**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that none of the requested ranges are satisfiable.
- **Problem Solved:** Provided clear feedback for invalid range requests.

**417 Expectation Failed**
- **Purpose:** Indicates the server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.
- **Problem Solved:** Formalized failure handling for advanced HTTP/1.1 features.

### 5xx (Server Error)

**501 Not Implemented**
- **Purpose:** Indicates the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- **Problem Solved:** Distinguished between server errors and functionality limitations.

**502 Bad Gateway**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that a server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **Problem Solved:** Clarified error sources in multi-server architectures.

**503 Service Unavailable**
- **Purpose:** Indicates the server is temporarily unable to handle the request due to overloading or maintenance.
- **Problem Solved:** Provided a standard way to signal temporary service disruption.

**504 Gateway Timeout**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that a gateway or proxy timed out waiting for a response from an upstream server.
- **Problem Solved:** Distinguished between direct server timeouts and gateway/proxy timeouts.

**505 HTTP Version Not Supported**
- **Purpose:** Indicates that the server doesn't support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.
- **Problem Solved:** Provided clear feedback when protocol version mismatches occurred.

## Significance

These new status codes filled crucial gaps in the HTTP protocol's ability to communicate specific error conditions and operational states. They enabled:

1. More efficient network resource utilization through granular error reporting
2. Better support for distributed systems and content delivery networks
3. Enhanced security through specific rejection codes
4. Standardized ways to handle emerging use cases like media streaming and conditional modifications
5. Formalization of web application patterns that have become fundamental to modern web architecture

While HTTP/1.0 provided the basic framework with essential status codes like 200 (OK) and 404 (Not Found), HTTP/1.1's expanded status code system addressed the growing complexity of web applications and services, providing developers with a more expressive communication protocol that remains relevant even in the era of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
