# HTTP/3 Overview

## What is HTTP/3
HTTP/3 is the latest version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, built on top of the QUIC transport protocol. It improves speed, security, and reliability compared to previous versions like HTTP/2, which relied on TCP.

## Key Features and Benefits of HTTP/3

### Based on QUIC
- Uses QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), a multiplexed transport protocol built on UDP instead of TCP.

### Improved Performance
- **Faster Connection Establishment:** QUIC combines TLS handshake and encryption setup into a single step, reducing round trips and latency.

- **Multiplexing:** Allows multiple streams (requests/responses) to be sent over a single connection, improving efficiency.
- **Stream Prioritization:** Ensures that critical data loads faster.
- **Better Congestion Control:** Uses techniques like Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT (BBR) for improved congestion control, enhancing performance in challenging network conditions.

### Connection Migration
- Supports connection migration, allowing connections to seamlessly switch between networks (e.g., Wi-Fi to cellular) without disruption.

 

## How HTTP/3 Works

1. **QUIC Connection:** A client initiates a QUIC connection with the server.
2. **TLS Handshake:** The TLS handshake and encryption setup are combined into a single step.
3. **HTTP/3 Framing:** Once the QUIC connection is established, HTTP/3 uses a framing layer similar to HTTP/2 to manage data exchange.
4. **Multiplexing and Stream Prioritization:** QUIC allows multiple streams to be sent concurrently, and HTTP/3 manages stream prioritization to optimize performance.
