# Stream Prioritization Overview

## What is Stream Prioritization
Stream prioritization is a technique used in network communication to manage multiple data streams efficiently by assigning different priority levels based on their importance. It ensures that critical data is transmitted with minimal delay while optimizing resource utilization.

## Stream Prioritization in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
### HTTP/2
- Uses a dependency-based prioritization model where streams can have **parent-child relationships**.
- Allows assigning weight values to prioritize certain streams over others.
- Helps optimize webpage loading by prioritizing CSS, JavaScript, and images accordingly.

### HTTP/3
- Simplifies prioritization compared to HTTP/2 by avoiding complex **dependency trees**.
- Uses a more flexible approach where clients and servers **dynamically adjust stream handling**.
- Benefits from QUIC's multiplexing, reducing head-of-line blocking even for lower-priority streams.

### Priority Parameters
- **Urgency(u):** From 0 (highest) to 7 (lowest).
- **Incremental:** Boolean (true/false) flag:
	- **true** = send incrementally as data is available.
    - **false** = wait until more complete data is available.




## Benefits of Stream Prioritization
- Improves user experience by ensuring important content loads first.
- Prevents less critical streams from blocking high-priority data.
- Ensures efficient delivery of critical content such as UI elements before background data.
- Enhances performance in real-time applications like video streaming and gaming.
- Reduces **congestion** by balancing bandwidth allocation across multiple streams.
