# Stream Prioritization Overview

## What is Stream Prioritization
Stream prioritization is a technique used in network communication to manage multiple data streams efficiently by **assigning different priority levels based on their importance**. It ensures that critical data is transmitted with minimal delay while optimizing resource utilization.

## Stream Prioritization in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
### HTTP/2
- Uses a dependency-based prioritization model where streams can have **parent-child relationships**.
- Allows assigning weight values to prioritize certain streams over others.
- Helps optimize webpage loading by prioritizing CSS, JavaScript, and images accordingly.

### HTTP/3
- Simplifies prioritization compared to HTTP/2 by avoiding complex **dependency trees**.
- Uses a more flexible approach where clients and servers **dynamically adjust stream handling**.
- Benefits from QUIC's multiplexing, reducing **head-of-line blocking** even for lower-priority streams.

### Priority Parameters
- **Urgency(u):** From 0 (highest) to 7 (lowest).
- **Incremental:** Boolean (true/false) flag:
	- **true** = send incrementally as data is available.
    - **false** = wait until more complete data is available.




## Benefits of Stream Prioritization
- Improves **user experience** by ensuring important content loads first.
- Prevents less critical streams from blocking high-priority data.
- Ensures efficient delivery of critical content such as **UI elements before background data**.
- Enhances performance in **real-time applications** like video streaming and gaming.
