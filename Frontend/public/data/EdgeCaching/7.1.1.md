# Edge Caching vs Normal Caching

## What is Normal (Origin) Caching?

- Stores cached data on the **origin server** or close to it.
- Works well, but users far from the origin may experience **higher latency**.

## What is Edge Caching?

- Stores content on **edge servers**, physically closer to end-users.
- Typically powered by **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)** spread across the globe.

## Why Edge Caching Is Needed Over Normal Caching

### 1. Reduced Latency
- Users receive data from the nearest edge server, reducing load time.

### 2. Improved Scalability
- Handles large traffic volumes without stressing the origin server.

### 3. Better User Experience
- Faster load times for both new and returning users.

### 4. Bandwidth Savings
- Reduces traffic to the origin server, lowering costs.

### 5. Increased Availability & Resilience
- Can serve cached content even when the origin is down.

### 6. Optimized for Modern Web & Mobile
- Supports device-specific optimization (e.g., responsive images).

### 7. Security Benefits
- Provides built-in protection (e.g., DDoS mitigation, WAF).

## Comparison Table

| Feature             | Normal Caching          | Edge Caching               |
|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Location            | Origin Server           | Global Edge Nodes          |
| Speed               | Slower for distant users| Fast, closer to users      |
| Resilience          | Depends on origin       | High, can serve when offline |
| Scalability         | Limited                 | Highly Scalable            |
| Bandwidth Cost      | Higher                  | Lower                      |
