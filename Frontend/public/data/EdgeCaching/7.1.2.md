## What is Third-Party Cookie?
A third-party cookie is a cookie set by a domain different from the one the user is currently visiting. These cookies are primarily used for tracking, advertising, and cross-site functionalities.

## How Third-Party Cookies Work (Step by Step)
1. User visits `websiteA.com`
2. `websiteA.com` includes third-party content (ads, tracking pixels) from `tracker.com`
3. `tracker.com` sets a third-party cookie in the browser
4. When the user visits `websiteB.com`, which also loads `tracker.com`, the cookie is sent back
5. `tracker.com` identifies the user and provides personalized ads or analytics

## Difference Between First-Party and Third-Party Cookies
| Feature          | First-Party Cookies     | Third-Party Cookies  |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Set By         | The website you visit  | A different website (e.g., ad tracker) |
| Use Case       | Logins, preferences, shopping carts | Advertising, tracking, analytics |
| Access Scope   | Only by the same website | Can be accessed by multiple websites |
| Security Risks | Lower risk | Higher privacy concerns |

## Privacy & Security Concerns
- User Tracking – Tracks behavior across multiple websites.
- Privacy Violations – Used for fingerprinting and profiling users.
- Security Risks – Can be exploited for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and tracking users without consent.
