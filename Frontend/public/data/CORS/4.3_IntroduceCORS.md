# Introduction of CORS

## Limitations of JSONP   
JSONP is one of the oldest cross-origin techniques out there and it enjoys wide browser support. But it has some drawbacks. 

<li> As JSONP uses a <code>script</code> tag, it can only support <b>GET</b> requests. There is no way to make a <b>POST, PUT</b> or <b>DELETE</b> request using JSONP. </li> 
<li>It is ideal for publicly available data.  </li>   
<li>JSONP lacks robust error-handling mechanisms. If the server responds with an error, it can be challenging to identify and handle it appropriately on the client side.</li>

## Modern Alternative to JSONP

While JSONP served as a viable solution for cross-origin data access in the past, newer and more secure methods have emerged. **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is now the recommended approach for cross-origin requests. CORS involves the server explicitly allowing cross-origin requests by including specific HTTP headers in its response. It provides better security and more flexibility compared to JSONP.

The **W3C Working Draft** was submitted in 2006. It was named as **CORS** in 2009\. **Cross-origin resource sharing** (**CORS**) is a mechanism that allows web pages to access resources from a different domain while bypassing the **same-origin policy** safely. Using CORS, we are now able to read the resources of other domains if we are allowed to read it. Basically, the server explicitly allows **cross-origin** requests by including specific HTTP headers in its response.   

The mechanism classifies three different categories of subresource access:

<li>Cross-origin writes
<li>Cross-origin embeds
<li>Cross-origin reads
<br><br>

<b>Cross-origin writes</b> includes form submissions which is <b>allowed</b>.  <br> 

**Cross-origin embeds** are subresources loaded via: <code> script, link, img, video, audio, object, embed, iframe</code>. These are all <b>allowed</b> by default. 
When it comes to <code>img</code> and the other embeddable subresources – it’s in their nature to trigger cross-origin requests. That’s why in CORS differentiates between cross-origin embeds and cross-origin reads and treats them differently.

**Cross-origin reads** are subresources loaded via <code>AJAX / fetch</code> calls. These are by default **blocked** in our browser. 

<details>
<summary> Browser support</summary>  
CORS is a security feature enforced in the browser environment. CORS is supported by all browsers based on the following layout engines:

<li>Blink- and Chromium-based browsers (Chrome 28+, Opera 15+,Amazon Silk, Android's 4.4+ WebView and Qt's WebEngine)  </li>
<li>Gecko 1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5,[\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing#cite_note-10) SeaMonkey 2.0) and above.  </li>
<li>MSHTML/Trident 6.0 (Internet Explorer 10\) has native support. MSHTML/Trident 4.0 & 5.0 (Internet Explorer 8 & 9\) provide partial support via the XDomainRequest object. </li> 
<li>Presto-based browsers (Opera) implement CORS as of Opera 12.00 and Opera Mobile 12, but not Opera Mini. </li> 
<li>WebKit (Initial revision uncertain, Safari 4 and above, Google Chrome 3 and above, possibly earlier).</li>  
<li>Microsoft Edge All versions.</l>
