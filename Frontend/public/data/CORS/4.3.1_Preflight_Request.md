This is best conveyed by a story. Imagine it is 2004.  There was a news website named `X-News`. This site uses XMLHttpRequests to load news data from an API. The site lives under the same origin as API. Not only does this API fetch news stories, but also the owner could edit and delete news items. While the site has basic security measures in place, the site code never checks which origin a request is coming from, because why should it? 


All browsers enforce the same-origin policy. There is no such thing as CORS (remember this is 2004), so there is no way for clients from other origins to access this API.   


Now fast-forward to 2009. At one night the owner read that `Chrome 4.0` will be released soon and it supports this new feature called `Cross-Origin Resource Sharing` that allows cross-origin requests. The owner found this a bit troubling and that night he had nightmares of the server being deluged with all sorts of requests from servers across the web. He wake in a cold sweat wondering how he’ll protect his server from these cross-origin requests? Will users suddenly be able to send DELETE requests without his permission? Why would browsers suddenly break the same-origin policy he has come to rely on?


Luckily, CORS answers these questions. The arrival of CORS didn’t cause thousands of server administrators to wake in a cold sweat. In fact, when the CORS spec was being drafted, the spec authors recognized that CORS needed to be introduced in a way that was compatible with existing servers. The answer to preserving backward compatibility was to introduce the `preflight request`. 


The preflight request is a way for the browser to ask the server if it’s okay to send a cross-origin request before sending the actual request. The same-origin policy is still preserved because the request is never made unless the server grants permission. An existing server that knows nothing about CORS can safely ignore the preflight request, and the browser will not forward the actual request to the server.

This story demonstrates why the preflight was introduced. It allows cross-origin requests to be introduced to the web in a way that doesn’t adversely affect existing servers.  


## When is a Preflight request sent?

A web page can easily make GET requests to another origin. Every `<script>` tag or `<img>` tag issues a GET request. A web page can make POST requests via the `<form>` tag. The `<form>` tag also allows the Content-Type header to be set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain. These techniques existed long before the concept of CORS and preflights. Because the browser can make these requests without CORS, the preflight doesn’t provide any additional value.


When a request meets any of the following criteria:


1. It uses an HTTP method other than GET, POST, or HEAD
2. It sets the Content-Type request header with values other than
 a. application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 b. multipart/form-data
 c. text/plain
3. It sets additional request headers that are not
 a. Accept  b. Accept-Language
 c. Content-Language 
 d. Content-Type


## The Characteristics of Preflight Request

There are three characteristics of a preflight request.
1. it uses the HTTP OPTIONS method 
2. it has an Origin request header 
3. it has an Access-Control-Request-Method header 

All three characteristics must exist on the request for it to be a preflight request. If any one of these pieces is missing, the request isn’t a preflight. 

<br>

`Access-Control-Request-Headers` includes additional or custom headers of the request. In response, the server includes `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` which tells us that which headers are allowed to make request with.`Access-Control-Expose-Headers` which indicates which response headers are visible to the client.
<!-- Accessing response headers of cross origin request is a new capability introduced by CORS. Before CORS existed, clients had no way of reading the response headers of cross origin request. Access-Control-Expose-Headers  -->

## Preflight Cache

The preflight request has some sort of performance issue. AS we are intiating two requests each time, it takes some time. To reduce latency, preflight response can be cached in browser. The cache is a black box that is maintained internally by the browser. But the server can have some control over how long items stay in the cache by using the `Access-Control-Max-Age` header.

## Summary of CORS headers


| Header                         | Description                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | Specifies the origin(s) allowed to access the resource. Can be a specific origin or `*`.         |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`| Lists the HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) that are allowed when accessing the resource.       |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`| Specifies which custom headers can be used in the actual request.                                |
| `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` | Indicates whether credentials (cookies, HTTP auth) can be included. `true` or omitted.        |
| `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`| Identifies which headers can be exposed to the browser (e.g., `X-Custom-Header`).                |
| `Access-Control-Max-Age`      | Defines how long the results of a preflight request can be cached (in seconds).                  |
| `Access-Control-Request-Method`| Used in preflight requests to indicate the desired HTTP method.                                 |
| `Access-Control-Request-Headers`| Used in preflight requests to list custom headers the client wants to send.                     |
| `Origin`                      | Sent by the browser in every CORS request to indicate the source origin of the request.          |

Initially we enjoyed CORS with simple request methods and CORS safelisted headers. Later on, there came the concern for complex requests. Complex requests mean a request involves methods rather than simple methods like GET, POST, headers beyond CORS safelisted headers. CORS safelisted headers are Accept, Accept-language, Content-Language, Content-Type. Questions arose like what if we want to make a complex request? The first response was like we can't do it because the site might not want us to. Below is an example: 
<br><br>
<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/CORS/assets/image19.png" height="500" width="1000" style='border: 2px solid black'></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 01</figcaption>  
</figure>  
<br>

Here we can see that we have gotten an error because we are not allowed to make a **PUT** request. So the CORS designers came up with a solution.

The solution is **Preflight Requests** by which the browser can know beforehand of a direct request to a server whether the request methods or headers are allowed or not.  It works like “**Sanity Check”.**
<br><br>
We perform the preflight request for the methods which are not simple methods like **PUT, PATCH, DELETE** or for headers which are not **CORS-safelisted request headers.**. By preflight request, we can check whether we are allowed to make the request to the server. Below is an example with an explanation.

<li> At first the browser makes a request with the OPTIONS method to the server along with the headers like:   
<br><br>

	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 03</figcaption>  
</figure> 


<li> The server responds with the corresponding headers like

	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 04</figcaption>  
</figure> 

<li>If the methods, headers in the request are allowed, then the browser can make the actual request to the server.   

<br><br>
<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/CORS/assets/image23.png" height="700" width="500" style='border: 2px solid black'></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 05</figcaption>  
</figure>  

<li> The server sends responses to the clients.

Since preflight requests involve making two requests to the server, they add latency. To optimize this, the **Access-Control-Max-Age** header is used. This header specifies how long the browser can cache the preflight response, reducing the need for repeated preflight requests within the specified time.
