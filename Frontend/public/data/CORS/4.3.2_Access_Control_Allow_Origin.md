# Access-Control-Allow-Origin

Initially, the CORS designers established rules for requests such as **GET and POST**. These are called **Simple Requests**. For reading responses of different domains in the browser, the concept of **origin** header in the request message and **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header in the response message were introduced.   
If the value of the **origin** header and  **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header matches, then the client is allowed to read the response of the server. Below is the flow of the process with an example: 
<br><br>

<li> The client (foo.example.com) makes a GET request to the server (bar.example.com) with the <b>Origin</b>  header in the request message. The value of the <b>Origin</b> header is the client itself (foo.example.com).   
<li> The server receives the request. It processes the request. Then it responds to the client. The response message includes the <b>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</b> header with the value of the origin which is allowed to read the response in the browser. Here the value of the header is similar to the requesting origin (foo.example.com). That means the requesting site is able to read the response in the browser environment.

This was kind of limitations that following the above approach we could allow specific origins. If we have a static public site and we want to allow it for all, then how will we allow it? Mentioning every possible origin in the response **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header is not feasible.
<br><br>

Some people proposed that can't we use **\*** to allow everyone to read responses? But the concern of the designers of the CORS is that **\*** was already used in the **Flash.** Everyone with that setting had a security vulnerability issue.
<br><br>

Then the solution came. The solution was **ACAO: \*** with specifying Access-Control-Allow-Credentials to <code>false</code>. Because allowing * while sending credentials would be a security risk, as it would enable any website to access authenticated resources from another domain.
<br><br>

Below is an example of **ACAO with \*.**

<li> The client (foo.example) makes a GET request to the server (bar.example.com) with the <b>Origin</b>  header in the request message. The value of the <b>Origin</b> header is the client itself (foo.example.com). The request message can be like this:

<li> The server receives the request. It processes the request. Then it responds to the client request. The response message includes the <b>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</b> header with the value of the origin which is allowed to read the response in the browser. Here the value of the header is <code>*</code>. That means any requesting site is able to read the response in their browser environment. The response message can be like this:  
<br><br>

But if we need to send **credential** data along with the request, the server can’t set the value of the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin** header to **\***. In that case, the server needs to specify the origin which is allowed to access the response. Below is an example of **Access-Control-Allow-credential:** 
<br><br>

<li> The client requests with the cookie header in the request message. The request message can be like this:    

<br><br>

	<div align="center">

	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 06</figcaption>  
</figure>

<li> The server responds with the headers <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true</code>. This is crucial because it tells the browser that the server allows credentials (cookies, authorization headers, etc.) to be included in cross-origin requests. The response message can be like this:   
   
<br><br>

## What happens when the server does not specify the ACAO header

A client wants to access the resources from another domain but the server does not give access to the resource to the client. The client can’t access the resources due to the **CORS Policy**. The client gets error like this: 
<br><br>
<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/CORS/assets/image8.png" height="500" width="1000" style='border: 2px solid black'></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 08</figcaption>  
</figure>  

It tells us that the client gets an error due to the no mention of Access-Control-Allow-Header in the response which is set by server.
