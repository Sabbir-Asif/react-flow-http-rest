# The Six Guiding Principles of REST

REST (Representational State Transfer) has a set of constraints that define how systems should be designed to ensure scalability, performance, and simplicity.

## 1. Uniform Interface in REST  

A <b>uniform interface</b> simplifies system architecture by ensuring consistent interactions between the client and server. Four key constraints help achieve this:  

<li> <b>Resource Identification</b> – Every resource must have a unique identifier (URI).  </li>
<li> <b>Resource Manipulation via Representations</b> – Clients interact with resources using standardized formats like JSON or XML.  </li>
<li> <b>Self-Descriptive Messages</b> – Each response contains enough details to tell the client what actions are possible.  </li>
<li> <b>Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)</b> – Clients navigate resources dynamically using links provided in responses.  </li>

## Example  
A REST API returns a user’s profile.

### **Request:**  
```http
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

- The **URI (`/users/123`)** uniquely identifies the resource.  
- The response is in a **standard format (JSON)**.  

</br>

## 2. Client-Server  

The client-server design pattern enforces the separation of concerns, which helps the client and the server components evolve independently.  

## Example 
A web client fetching data from a REST API.


#### **Client**
```javascript
fetch('https://example.com/products')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

#### **Server**
```javascript
app.get('/products', (req, res) => {
  res.json([
    { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 1200 },
    { id: 2, name: "Phone", price: 800 }
  ]);
});
```

- The client requests resources but doesn’t manage data storage.  
- The server handles business logic and database interactions.   


<br>

## 3. Stateless
Each request from a client must contain all the necessary information, and the server should not store client session data.


#### **Request:**
```http
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer abc123
```

<li> The server does not store session state between requests. </li>
<li> Each request must provide authentication (e.g., Authorization header). </li>

<br>

## 4. Cacheable  

The cacheable constraint requires that a response should implicitly or explicitly label itself as cacheable or non-cacheable.  
If the response is cacheable, the client application gets the right to reuse the response data later for equivalent requests and a specified period.


#### **Request:**
```http
GET /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

#### **Response with Cache Control:**
```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "REST Constraints",
  "content": "Caching improves performance..."
}
```

<li> The response can be cached for 3600 seconds (1 hour). </li>
<li> Clients won’t need to request the same data repeatedly. </li>  

<br>

## 5. Layered System  

The layered system style allows an architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior. In a layered system, each component cannot see beyond the immediate layer they are interacting with.

## 6. Code on Demand (Optional)  

REST also allows client functionality to extend by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.

The downloaded code simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented. Servers can provide part of features delivered to the client in the form of code, and the client only needs to execute the code.

#### **Server Response:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/javascript

console.log("This script was sent by the server.");
```

#### **Client (Browser executes script):**
```javascript
fetch("https://example.com/script.js")
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(code => eval(code)); // Executes server-sent JavaScript
```

<li> The server can provide dynamic behavior to the client.
<li> The client can execute code-on-demand for extended functionality.
```
