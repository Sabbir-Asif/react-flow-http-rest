# Understanding the Richardson Maturity Model (RMM) in REST APIs

In the world of RESTful APIs, not all implementations are created equal. Some APIs barely adhere to REST principles, while others fully embrace the architecture. To categorize these levels of adherence, Leonard Richardson introduced the **Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)**. This model helps software engineers understand how RESTful an API is by breaking it into four distinct levels.


## What is the Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)?

RMM categorizes RESTful APIs into four levels (0 to 3), based on how well they leverage REST principles such as HTTP methods, resources, and hypermedia. These levels are:

1. **Level 0 - The Swamp of POX (Plain Old XML/JSON)**
2. **Level 1 - Resources**
3. **Level 2 - HTTP Verbs**
4. **Level 3 - Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)**

Each level builds upon the previous one, making APIs more RESTful as they progress.


## Level 0: The Swamp of POX

At level 0, the API does not take advantage of HTTP conventions. Instead, it uses HTTP as a transport mechanism for remote procedure calls (RPC). The API typically exposes a single endpoint (e.g., `/api`) and performs all operations via `POST`. The request body contains the action to be executed.

### Example (Node.js + Express)
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api', (req, res) => {
    const { action, data } = req.body;
    if (action === 'getUser') {
        res.json({ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' });
    } else {
        res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid action' });
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```
### Issues
- Uses a single endpoint for all actions.
- HTTP methods are not used correctly.
- Not resource-oriented.


## Level 1: Resources

At level 1, the API introduces **resources**. Instead of a single endpoint, different endpoints represent different entities (e.g., `/users`, `/products`). However, it still might misuse HTTP methods.

### Example
```javascript
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ id: 1, name: req.body.name });
});

app.post('/users/getUser', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' });
});
```
### Issues
- Resources are defined, but HTTP methods are still not used correctly (e.g., `/users/getUser` instead of `GET /users/1`).


## Level 2: HTTP Methods

At level 2, the API correctly uses HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to perform operations on resources. This improves API usability and aligns with RESTful principles.

### Example
```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ id: req.params.id, name: 'John Doe' });
});

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ id: 2, name: req.body.name });
});

app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ id: req.params.id, name: req.body.name });
});

app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'User deleted' });
});
```
### Benefits
- Resources are clearly defined.
- HTTP methods are used appropriately.
- The API becomes more predictable and standardized.


## Level 3: Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)

At level 3, the API introduces **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**. This means that API responses include links to related actions, making it self-descriptive and navigable.

### Example
```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    const user = { id: req.params.id, name: 'John Doe' };
    res.json({
        ...user,
        links: {
            self: `/users/${user.id}`,
            update: `/users/${user.id}/update`,
            delete: `/users/${user.id}/delete`
        }
    });
});
```
### Benefits
- Clients can dynamically discover available actions.
- Reduces reliance on out-of-band documentation.
- Makes APIs more flexible and evolvable.

| Level  | Description                         | Characteristics                     |
|--------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **0**  | The Swamp of POX                   | Single endpoint, RPC-style         |
| **1**  | Resources                          | Resource-based but misuses methods |
| **2**  | HTTP Methods                       | Correct use of HTTP methods        |
| **3**  | Hypermedia (HATEOAS)               | Links guide API interactions       |
