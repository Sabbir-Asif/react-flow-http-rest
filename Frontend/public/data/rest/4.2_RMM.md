# Understanding the Richardson Maturity Model (RMM) in REST APIs

In the world of RESTful APIs, not all implementations are created equal. Some APIs barely adhere to REST principles, while others fully embrace the architecture. To categorize these levels of adherence, Leonard Richardson introduced the **Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)**. This model helps software engineers understand how RESTful an API is by breaking it into four distinct levels.


## What is the Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)?

</figure>

RMM categorizes RESTful APIs into four levels (0 to 3), based on how well they leverage REST principles such as HTTP methods, resources, and hypermedia. These levels are:

1. **Level 0 - The Swamp of POX (Plain Old XML/JSON)**
2. **Level 1 - Resources**
3. **Level 2 - HTTP Verbs**
4. **Level 3 - Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)**

Each level builds upon the previous one, making APIs more RESTful as they progress.


## Level 0: The Swamp of POX

At level 0, the API does not take advantage of HTTP conventions. Instead, it uses HTTP as a transport mechanism for remote procedure calls (RPC). The API typically exposes a single endpoint (e.g., `/api`) and performs all operations via `POST`. The request body contains the action to be executed.

### Example (Node.js + Express)

<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/rest/assets/img1.png" height="650" width="650"></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 02</figcaption>  
</figure>

### Issues
- Uses a single endpoint for all actions.
- HTTP methods are not used correctly.
- Not resource-oriented.


## Level 1: Resources

At level 1, the API introduces **resources**. Instead of a single endpoint, different endpoints represent different entities (e.g., `/users`, `/products`). However, it still might misuse HTTP methods.

### Example

<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/rest/assets/img2.png" height="550" width="650"></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 03</figcaption>  
</figure>

### Issues
- Resources are defined, but HTTP methods are still not used correctly.


## Level 2: HTTP Methods

At level 2, the API correctly uses HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to perform operations on resources. This improves API usability and aligns with RESTful principles.

### Example

<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/rest/assets/img3.png" height="550" width="550"></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 04</figcaption>  
</figure>


### Benefits
- Resources are clearly defined.
- HTTP methods are used appropriately.
- The API becomes more predictable and standardized.


## Level 3: Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)

At level 3, the API introduces **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**. This means that API responses include links to related actions, making it self-descriptive and navigable.

### Example
This GET request fetches an account resource, requesting details in a JSON representation:

<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/rest/assets/img4.png" height="350" width="350"></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 05</figcaption>  
</figure>

The response is:

<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/rest/assets/img5.png" height="550" width="550"></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 06</figcaption>  
</figure>

The response contains these possible follow-up links: POST a deposit, withdrawal, transfer, or close request (to close the account).

As an example, later, after the account has been overdrawn, there is a different set of available links, because the account is overdrawn.

<figure>
	<div align="center">
	<img src="/data/rest/assets/img6.png" height="550" width="550"></div>
	<figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig: 07</figcaption>  
</figure>

Now only one link is available: to deposit more money (by POSTing to deposits). In its current state, the other links are not available. Hence the term **Engine of Application State**. What actions are possible varies as the state of the resource varies.

### Benefits
- Clients can dynamically discover available actions.
- Makes APIs more flexible and evolvable.


## Summary Table

| Level  | Description                         | Characteristics                     |
|--------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **0**  | The Swamp of POX                   | Single endpoint, RPC-style         |
| **1**  | Resources                          | Resource-based but misuses methods |
| **2**  | HTTP Methods                       | Correct use of HTTP methods        |
| **3**  | Hypermedia (HATEOAS)               | Links guide API interactions       |
