# REST (Representational State Transfer)

REST is an architectural style where hyperlinked multimedia content (such as text, images, videos, and documents) is distributed across multiple networked computers. Users can access and navigate this content remotely using links.

It is an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows a client to communicate with the server over the internet.

REST APIs utilize HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on web resources. A client sends a request to the server via a URL, and the server responds with the requested resource, often in JSON format, which is the most common for modern web services.

## Before REST API was introduced  

Before REST became the dominant API style, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) was widely used for web services. 

## Characteristics of SOAP API

<li>Uses XML for messages and works over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.</li>
<li>Enforces WSDL for contracts and supports WS-Security for encryption & authentication.</li>
<li>Strong typing, supports stateful/stateless modes, and uses SOAP Faults for error handling.</li>
<li>XML overhead makes it slower than REST but is ideal for enterprise apps & legacy systems.</li>

## Limitations of SOAP API

<li>XML-based messaging makes SOAP bulky and slower compared to REST.</li>
<li>Requires strict standards, WSDL definitions, and extensive configuration.</li>
<li>SOAP APIs are not easily consumed by web browsers compared to RESTful APIs.</li>

### Example SOAP Request

## Problems REST Solves for SOAP API

<li>REST uses lightweight formats like JSON, reducing message size and parsing time compared to SOAP's XML-based messaging.</li>
<li>REST APIs are easier to implement, as they don't require complex WSDL definitions or heavy configurations.</li>
<li>REST's stateless nature and lightweight data format lead to faster communication and better scalability.</li>
<li>REST allows multiple formats (JSON, XML, HTML) for responses, making it more versatile than SOAP's strict XML format.</li>
