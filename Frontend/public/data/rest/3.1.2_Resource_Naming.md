# Resource Naming in REST APIs

When designing a REST API, choosing meaningful and intuitive resource names is crucial. A well-structured API is easy to understand and use, while a poorly designed one can be confusing and difficult to work with. Resource naming plays a key role in creating a clear, navigable API structure.

## The Collection Metaphor

A RESTful API primarily consists of collections and individual resources. Each resource should be accessible through consistent and predictable URLs:

<li> A collection of resources (e.g., all users) should be represented by a single URL: `/users` </li>
<li> A specific resource within a collection (e.g., a user with ID 1234) should be accessible via: `/users/1234`</li>



These URLs serve as unique addresses for resources, and HTTP methods (such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`) define the operations that can be performed on them.

### Naming Resources as Nouns

A RESTful URI should represent a **thing** rather than an **action**. Resources should be named using **nouns**, not verbs. This makes APIs more intuitive and aligns with REST principles.


## Structuring URIs with Hierarchy

RESTful APIs should reflect the natural hierarchy of data. Relationships between resources should be represented in the URI structure. This makes it clear how resources relate to one another.

Consider an **order management system** with customers, orders, and products. The API should reflect the relationships between these entities:

### Customer Resource

- Create a new customer:
  ```http
  POST /customers
  ```
- Retrieve a customer by ID:
  ```http
  GET /customers/33245
  ```
- Update a customer's details:
  ```http
  PUT /customers/33245
  ```
- Delete a customer:
  ```http
  DELETE /customers/33245
  ```

### Product Resource

- Create a new product:
  ```http
  POST /products
  ```
- Retrieve a product by ID:
  ```http
  GET /products/66432
  ```
- Update a product:
  ```http
  PUT /products/66432
  ```
- Delete a product:
  ```http
  DELETE /products/66432
  ```

### Order Resource

An order belongs to a customer. The hierarchy should reflect this relationship:

- Create a new order for a customer:
  ```http
  POST /customers/33245/orders
  ```
- Retrieve all orders for a customer:
  ```http
  GET /customers/33245/orders
  ```
- Retrieve a specific order:
  ```http
  GET /orders/8769
  ```
- Add a line item to an order:
  ```http
  POST /orders/8769/lineitems
  ```
- Retrieve all line items for an order:
  ```http
  GET /orders/8769/lineitems
  ```
- Retrieve a specific line item:
  ```http
  GET /orders/8769/lineitems/1
  ```

This hierarchical structure makes it clear which resources belong to others while still allowing flexibility in retrieval.

## Best Practices for Resource Naming

Follow these guidelines to design clear, consistent, and user-friendly RESTful APIs:

1. **Use meaningful nouns, not verbs** – Resources should represent objects, not actions.
   -  `/orders` (Good)
   -  `/createOrder` (Bad)

2. **Use plural names for collections** – This keeps URLs consistent.
   -  `/customers`
   -  `/customer`

3. **Avoid including actions in URIs** – Use HTTP methods to define actions.
   -  `GET /users/1234` (Good)
   -  `GET /getUser/1234` (Bad)

4. **Keep URIs predictable and hierarchical** – Nest resources logically.
   -  `/customers/33245/orders/8769` (Good)
   -  `/getOrderByCustomer?custId=33245&orderId=8769` (Bad)

5. **Use lowercase letters and hyphens for readability** – Some servers ignore case, so keep URLs consistent.
   -  `/users/1234/orders` (Good)
   -  `/Users/1234/Orders` (Bad)

6. **Minimize query parameters for resource identification** – Use them for filtering, not for resource identification.
   - `/users/1234` (Good)
   - `/api?type=user&id=1234` (Bad)
