# Persistent Connections and Multiplexing

## Persistent Connections in HTTP/2
- HTTP/2 keeps a **persistent connection** open for multiple requests and responses between the client and server.
- Unlike HTTP/1.1, where a new TCP connection might be created for each request or reused with limitations, HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to flow through a single connection without the overhead of opening new connections.

## Multiplexing in HTTP/2
- **Multiplexing** allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single TCP connection.
- This is achieved through the use of streams, which are independent and can carry multiple messages simultaneously, improving performance and reducing latency.
- Each stream is assigned a unique identifier, and data can be interleaved, so that a response doesn't have to wait for earlier ones to complete.

## Head-of-Line (HoL) Blocking in HTTP/2
- **Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking** occurs when one request blocks the entire queue of responses.
- In HTTP/1.1, requests were handled one by one (in order), and the first request in the queue had to complete before others could proceed, leading to delays.

- **HTTP/2 improves on this** by allowing requests to be multiplexed, but **HoL blocking can still occur at the stream level** if a stream is blocked due to issues like waiting for server-side resources or network congestion.

## Benefits of Multiplexing
- **Reduced Latency**: Multiple requests can be processed simultaneously without waiting for others to finish.
- **Improved Throughput**: Efficient use of a single connection reduces the need to open multiple TCP connections.

## Limitations of Multiplexing
- While HTTP/2 improves upon HTTP/1.1, **HoL blocking** can still be an issue if there is a single request that dominates or causes delays in the entire connection.
- **Solutions** to mitigate this often involve stream prioritization or optimization at the server level.
