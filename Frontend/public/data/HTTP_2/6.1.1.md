# Multiplexing in HTTP/2
- **Multiplexing** allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single TCP connection.
- This is achieved through the use of streams, which are independent and can carry multiple messages simultaneously, improving performance and reducing latency.
- Each stream is assigned a unique identifier, and data can be interleaved, so that a response doesn't have to wait for earlier ones to complete.

- HTTP/2 improves on the **Head-of-Line (HOL)** by allowing requests to be multiplexed, but HoL blocking can still occur at the **stream level/transport layer** if a stream is blocked due to issues like waiting for server-side resources or network congestion. But solves the application level **HOL** of HTTP 1.1.

### Head-of-Line (HoL) Blocking 
- Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking occurs when one request blocks the entire queue of responses.
- In HTTP/1.1, requests were handled one by one (in order), and the first request in the queue had to complete before others could proceed, leading to delays.
