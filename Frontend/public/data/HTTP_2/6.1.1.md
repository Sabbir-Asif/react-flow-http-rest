# Multiplexing in HTTP/2
- HTTP/2 improves on the **Head-of-Line (HOL)** by allowing requests to be multiplexed, but HoL blocking can still occur at the **stream level/transport layer** if a stream is blocked due to issues like waiting for server-side resources, network congestion or packet lost, all streams wait for that packet to be retransmitted (since TCP guarantees ordered delivery).
In HTTP/1.1, requests were handled one by one (in order), and the first request in the queue had to complete before others could proceed, leading to delays.

- **Multiplexing** allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single TCP connection.
- This is achieved through the use of streams, which are independent and can carry multiple messages simultaneously, improving performance and reducing latency.
- Each stream is assigned a unique identifier, and data can be interleaved, so that a response doesn't have to wait for earlier ones to complete.

# Binary Framing in HTTP/2
HTTP/1.1 messages are plain-text and line-based, parsed character by character. Because lines vary in length and parsing relies on newline delimiters, processing is less efficient. Furthermore, only one message can be transmitted per connection at a time, causing delays when multiple requests are queued.

Binary framing in HTTP/2 solves these limitations:

- **Multiplexing:** Multiple messages can be interleaved over one connection.
- **Efficient parsing:** Binary format is easier for machines to process.
- **Stream isolation:** Frames are tagged with stream IDs, preventing interference.
- **Header compression:** HTTP/2 uses HPACK to reduce header size and bandwidth.

Each HTTP/2 message is divided into **frames**, the smallest units of communication. Every frame begins with a fixed 9-byte header, which includes:

- **Length (24 bits):** Size of the frame payload.
- **Type (8 bits):** Identifies the frameâ€™s purpose (e.g., HEADERS, DATA).
- **Flags (8 bits):** Control frame-specific behavior.
- **Stream Identifier (31 bits + 1 reserved bit):** Specifies which stream the frame belongs to.
