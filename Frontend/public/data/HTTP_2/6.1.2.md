# HTTP/2: Request Components  

HTTP/2 introduces several optimizations over HTTP/1.1, including multiplexing, header compression, and binary framing. While the core request components remain similar, HTTP/2 represents them using **pseudo-header fields** to streamline communication between the client and server.This document outlines the key components of an HTTP/2 request.  

## 1. Method  
The **method** specifies the action to be performed on a resource. HTTP/2 retains the same methods as HTTP/1.1 but sends them as a **pseudo-header field** (`:method`).  

### Common HTTP Methods:  
- **GET** – Retrieve a resource.  
- **POST** – Send data to the server.  
- **PUT** – Update a resource.  
- **DELETE** – Remove a resource.  

### Example:  
```http
:method: GET
```

## 2. Scheme  
The **scheme** defines the protocol used in the request. This ensures secure and consistent communication between the client and server. It is sent as a **pseudo-header field** (`:scheme`).  

### Supported Schemes:  
- `http` – Standard, unencrypted HTTP communication.  
- `https` – Secure communication using TLS/SSL encryption.  

### Example:  
```http
:scheme: https
```

---

## 3. Authority  
The **authority** field represents the domain name and port of the server handling the request. It serves the same purpose as the `Host` header in HTTP/1.1 but is now explicitly defined as a **pseudo-header field** (`:authority`).  

### Example:  
```http
:authority: example.com
```

---

## 4. Path  
The **path** specifies the target resource on the server. In HTTP/1.1, the request target was part of the request line, but in HTTP/2, it is represented as a **pseudo-header field** (`:path`).  

### Example:  
```http
:path: /index.html
```

---

## 5. Accept-Encoding  
The `Accept-Encoding` header allows the client to specify which compression formats it supports. This helps reduce payload size and improve performance.  

### Common Compression Formats:  
- `gzip` – Widely used compression format.  
- `br` – Brotli compression, optimized for web performance.  
- `deflate` – A legacy compression algorithm.  

### Example:  
```http
accept-encoding: gzip, br
```
