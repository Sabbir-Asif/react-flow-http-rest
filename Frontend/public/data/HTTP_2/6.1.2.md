# HTTP/2: Request Components  

## 1. Method  
- The **method** specifies the action to be performed on the resource.  
- Common HTTP methods:  
  - GET (Retrieve a resource)  
  - POST (Send data to the server)  
  - PUT (Update a resource)  
  - DELETE (Remove a resource)  
- In HTTP/2, methods remain the same as in HTTP/1.1 but are sent as a **pseudo-header field** (:method).  

### Example:  
:method: GET

## 2. Scheme  
- The **scheme** defines the protocol used for the request (http or https).  
- It is included as a **pseudo-header field** (:scheme).  

### Example:

## 3. Authority  
- The **authority** represents the domain name and port of the server handling the request.  
- Equivalent to the Host header in HTTP/1.1.  
- Sent as a **pseudo-header field** (authority).  

### Example:  
:authority: example.com

## 4. Path  
- The **path** specifies the target resource on the server.  
- It replaces the request target from HTTP/1.1.  
- Sent as a **pseudo-header field** (path).  

### Example:  
:path: /index.html

## 5. Accept-Encoding  
- The Accept-Encoding header specifies which compression formats the client supports.  
- Common values:  
  - gzip (Compressed format)  
  - br (Brotli compression)  
  - deflate (Another compression algorithm)  
- Helps in reducing payload size and improving performance.  

### Example:  
accept-encoding: gzip, br
