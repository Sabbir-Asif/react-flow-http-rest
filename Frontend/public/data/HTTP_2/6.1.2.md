## Header Compression
HTTP/2 compresses headers using HPACK, significantly reducing overhead for repeated headers (like User-Agent, Cookie, etc.). It Maintains dynamic tables of previously seen headers. It uses Huffman encoding to minimize size.

Resolves the problem of large, repetitive headers that slowed down HTTP/1.1.

## Server Push
Allows the server to send resources to the client before they are requested. The server can proactively send resources the client might need (like CSS or JS) before the client requests them. It
- Reduces round-trip delays.
- Can be disabled by clients if needed.
