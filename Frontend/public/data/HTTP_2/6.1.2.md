## Header Compression
Each HTTP transfer carries a set of headers that describe the transferred resource and its properties. In HTTP/1.1, this metadata is always sent as plain text and adds anywhere from 500â€“800 bytes of overhead per transfer, and sometimes kilobytes more if HTTP cookies are being used. To reduce this overhead and improve performance, HTTP/2 compresses request and response header metadata using the HPACK compression format that uses two simple but powerful techniques.

- It allows the transmitted header fields to be encoded via a static Huffman code, which reduces their individual transfer size.
- It requires that both the client and server maintain and update an indexed list of previously seen header fields (in other words, it establishes a shared compression context), which is then used as a reference to efficiently encode previously transmitted values.

## Server Push
Allows the server to send resources to the client before they are requested. The server can proactively send resources the client might need (like CSS or JS) before the client requests them. It
- Reduces round-trip delays.
- Can be disabled by clients if needed.
