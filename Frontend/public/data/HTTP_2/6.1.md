### Problems of persistent connection

- **Head-of-line blocking**: In HTTP/1.1, requests were handled one by one (in order), and the first request in the queue had to complete before others could proceed, leading to delays.
- **Resource overhead**: Keeping connections open uses server memory and resources, especially when many users are connected at once.
- **Limited concurrency**: Even though the connection stays open, it can still only handle one request at a time unless pipelining is used — so it's not truly parallel.

### Problems of pipelining

Pipelining tries to improve on persistent connections by allowing the browser to send multiple requests one after another without waiting for responses. But it also has serious issues:

- **Strict response order**: The server must respond in the exact order the requests were sent. If the first response is delayed, all the following ones are delayed too. So the problems of **HOL** still persist.
- **Poor browser support**: Many browsers and servers had bugs or didn’t support it well, so most browsers eventually turned it off.
- **Complexity and delays**: It made the system more complex and prone to errors, especially when servers or proxies didn’t handle it correctly.

<br> <br>
Domain Sharding help with HOL. Because:
- Now you’re **not limited to 6 connections per domain**.
- If something is slow on `img1.example.com`, it **won’t block** downloads happening on `img2.example.com` or `css.example.com`.
- Each domain has its **own line**, reducing the chance that one slow file blocks others.

### Visual Example:

Without sharding (all on one domain):
```http
[Request A - slow] -> [Request B] -> [Request C]

Others wait.
```

With domain sharding:
``` http
img1.example.com: [A - slow]
img2.example.com: [B]
css.example.com:  [C]

No waiting!
```
### Problems of Domain Sharding

1. **Extra DNS Lookups** – Each subdomain adds latency by the process of translating a domain name (like www.google.com) into an IP address (like 142.250.190.68) by which our browser can connect to the correct server.
2. **Complex Setup** – Requires extra logic to split and serve assets.

|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Multiplexing         | Head-of-line blocking, pipelining inefficiency  |
| Header Compression   | Redundant large headers, bandwidth waste        |
| Server Push          | Extra round trips, slow resource loading        |
| Binary Protocol      | Text-based communication                        |
| Eliminates Sharding  | Workaround for connection limits                |
