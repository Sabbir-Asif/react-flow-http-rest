### Problems of persistent connection

- **Head-of-line blocking**: If one request is slow, all other requests behind it have to wait — they’re stuck in line.
- **Resource overhead**: Keeping connections open uses server memory and resources, especially when many users are connected at once.
- **Limited concurrency**: Even though the connection stays open, it can still only handle one request at a time unless pipelining is used — so it's not truly parallel.

### Problems of pipelining

Pipelining tries to improve on persistent connections by allowing the browser to send multiple requests one after another without waiting for responses. But it also has serious issues:

- **Strict response order**: The server must respond in the exact order the requests were sent. If the first response is delayed, all the following ones are delayed too. So the problems of **HOL** still persist.
- **Poor browser support**: Many browsers and servers had bugs or didn’t support it well, so most browsers eventually turned it off.
- **Complexity and delays**: It made the system more complex and prone to errors, especially when servers or proxies didn’t handle it correctly.

### Problems of Domain Sharding

1. **Extra DNS Lookups** – Each subdomain adds latency by the process of translating a domain name (like www.google.com) into an IP address (like 142.250.190.68) by which our browser can connect to the correct server.
2. **Complex Setup** – Requires extra logic to split and serve assets.

## Key Improvements in HTTP 2.0

| HTTP/2 Feature       | HTTP/1.1 Problem Solved                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Multiplexing         | Head-of-line blocking, pipelining inefficiency  |
| Header Compression   | Redundant large headers, bandwidth waste        |
| Server Push          | Extra round trips, slow resource loading        |
| Binary Protocol      | Text-based communication                        |
| Eliminates Sharding  | Workaround for connection limits                |
